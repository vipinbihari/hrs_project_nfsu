# HTTP Request Smuggling GUI Tool Updates

## [2024-01-09] Initial Setup
1. Created Maven project structure with necessary dependencies
   - Added JavaFX dependencies
   - Configured Maven Shade plugin for fat JAR creation

2. Created main GUI layout (`main.fxml`)
   - Added form fields for all CLI options
   - Implemented intuitive layout with GridPane
   - Added buttons for file selection
   - Added output text area for scan results

3. Created Java classes
   - `MainController.java`: Handles GUI interactions and Python script execution
   - `Main.java`: JavaFX application entry point
   - `Launcher.java`: Fat JAR entry point

4. Features implemented:
   - All CLI options available through GUI
   - Real-time output display
   - File chooser dialogs for log and config files
   - Start/Stop functionality
   - Clear output button
   - Error handling and user feedback

## [2024-01-09] Code Modularization
1. Refactored MainController into smaller, focused components:
   - Created `ProcessManager` class to handle Python script execution
   - Created `CommandBuilder` class for building command-line arguments
   - Created `UIHelper` class for common UI operations
   
2. Benefits of modularization:
   - Improved code organization and maintainability
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Easier to test individual components
   - More scalable for future features

## Build Instructions
1. Ensure you have JDK 11+ and Maven installed
2. Run `mvn clean package` to create the fat JAR
3. The JAR will be created in the `target` directory
4. Place the `smuggler.py` script in the same directory as the JAR
5. Run with `java -jar http-request-smuggler-gui-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
